# uoft-timetable-data

Three useful items in this repository.

## api.rb

This calls the St. George timetable API to retrieve course/enrolment information for each department, and outputs the most useful data points into a denormalized CSV file.

## notebooks

There's a Juypter notebook that does some very basic transformations of the data and produces summary statistics.

## data

Some point-in-time snapshots of the API data.
